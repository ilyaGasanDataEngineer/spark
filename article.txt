They are known as hummingbirds because of the humming sound created by their beating [[Bird's wing|wings]], which flap at high frequencies audible to other birds and humans. They hover at rapid wing-flapping rates, which vary from around 12 beats per second in the largest species to 80 per second in small hummingbirds.

As of 2023, 366 hummingbird species have been identified.<ref name=IOC/> They have been traditionally divided into two [[Subfamily|subfamilies]]: the [[hermit (hummingbird)|hermits]] (subfamily Phaethornithinae) and the typical hummingbirds (subfamily [[Trochilinae]], all the others). Molecular phylogenetic studies have shown, though, that the hermits are [[sister taxon|sister]] to the [[topaz (hummingbird)|topazes]], making the former definition of the Trochilinae not [[monophyletic]]. The hummingbirds form nine major [[clade]]s: the topazes and [[jacobin (hummingbird)|jacobins]], the hermits, the [[Anthracothorax|mangoes]], the [[Lophornis|coquettes]], the [[Heliodoxa|brilliants]], the [[giant hummingbird]] (''Patagona gigas''), the [[mountaingem]]s, the [[Mellisuga|bees]], and the [[Chlorostilbon|emeralds]].<ref name=mcguire2014/> The topazes and jacobins combined have the oldest split with the rest of the hummingbirds. The hummingbird family has the third-greatest number of species of any bird family (after the [[tyrant flycatcher]]s and the [[tanager]]s).<ref name=mcguire2014/><ref name="IOC"/>

Fossil hummingbirds are known from the [[Pleistocene]] of [[Brazil]] and the [[Bahamas]], but neither has yet been scientifically described, and fossils and subfossils of a few extant species are known. Until recently, older fossils had not been securely identifiable as those of hummingbirds.

In 2004, [[Gerald Mayr]] identified two 30-million-year-old hummingbird fossils. The fossils of this primitive hummingbird species, named ''[[Eurotrochilus]] inexpectatus'' ("unexpected European hummingbird"), had been sitting in a [[museum]] drawer in [[Stuttgart]]; they had been unearthed in a clay pit at [[Wiesloch]]–Frauenweiler, south of [[Heidelberg]], [[Germany]], and, because hummingbirds were assumed to have never occurred outside the Americas, were not recognized to be hummingbirds until Mayr took a closer look at them.<ref name=mayr2005/><ref name="Mayr2004">{{Cite journal |last=Mayr |first=Gerald |date=2004 |title=Old World fossil record of modern-type hummingbirds |journal=Science |volume=304 |issue=5672 |pages=861–864 |bibcode=2004Sci...304..861M |doi=10.1126/science.1096856 |pmid=15131303 |s2cid=6845608}}</ref>

Fossils of birds not clearly assignable to either hummingbirds or a related extinct family, the Jungornithidae, have been found at the [[Messel pit]] and in the [[Caucasus]], dating from 35 to 40 million years ago; this indicates that the split between these two lineages indeed occurred around that time. The areas where these early fossils have been found had a climate quite similar to that of the northern Caribbean or southernmost [[China]] during that time. The biggest remaining mystery at present is what happened to hummingbirds in the roughly 25 million years between the primitive ''Eurotrochilus'' and the modern fossils. The astounding morphological [[adaptation]]s, the decrease in size, and the dispersal to the Americas and extinction in Eurasia all occurred during this timespan. [[DNA–DNA hybridization]] results suggest that the main radiation of South American hummingbirds took place at least partly in the [[Miocene]], some 12 to 13 million years ago, during the uplifting of the northern [[Andes]].<ref name="Bleiweiss et al.">{{Cite journal |last1=Bleiweiss |first1=Robert |last2=Kirsch |first2=John A.

While all hummingbirds depend on flower nectar to fuel their high metabolisms and hovering flight, coordinated changes in flower and bill shape stimulated the formation of new species of hummingbirds and plants. Due to this exceptional [[evolution]]ary pattern, as many as 140 hummingbird species can coexist in a specific region, such as the Andes [[Mountain range|range]].<ref name="sd"/>

The hummingbird [[Phylogenetic tree|evolutionary tree]] shows that one key evolutionary factor appears to have been an altered [[taste receptor]] that enabled hummingbirds to seek nectar.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Baldwin |first1=M.W. |last2=Toda |first2=Y. |last3=Nakagita |first3=T. |last4=O'Connell |first4=M.J. |last5=Klasing |first5=K.C. |last6=Misaka |first6=T. |last7=Edwards |first7=S.V. |last8=Liberles |first8=S.

The Andes Mountains appear to be a particularly rich environment for hummingbird evolution because diversification occurred simultaneously with mountain uplift over the past 10 million years.<ref name="sd"/> Hummingbirds remain in dynamic diversification inhabiting ecological regions across South America, North America, and the Caribbean, indicating an enlarging [[evolutionary radiation]].<ref name="sd"/>

Hummingbirds can see [[wavelength]]s into the near-[[ultraviolet]], but hummingbird-pollinated flowers do not reflect these wavelengths as many insect-pollinated flowers do.

Sexual dimorphisms in bill size and shape are also present between male and female hummingbirds,<ref name="Berns2012"/> where in many clades, females have longer, more curved bills favored for accessing nectar from tall flowers.<ref name="Temeles2010">{{Cite journal |last1=Temeles |first1=Ethan J. |last2=Miller |first2=Jill S. |last3=Rifkin |first3=Joanna L. |date=2010-04-12 |title=Evolution of sexual dimorphism in bill size and shape of hermit hummingbirds (Phaethornithinae): a role for ecological causation |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences |volume=365 |issue=1543 |pages=1053–063 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2009.0284 |issn=0962-8436 |pmc=2830232 |pmid=20194168}}</ref> For males and females of the same size, females tend to have larger bills.<ref name="Berns2012"/>

Sexual size and bill differences likely evolved due to constraints imposed by courtship, because mating displays of male hummingbirds require complex aerial maneuvers.<ref name="Colwell2000"/> Males tend to be smaller than females, allowing conservation of energy to [[forage]] competitively and participate more frequently in courtship.<ref name="Colwell2000">{{Cite journal |last=Colwell |first=Robert K. |date=2000-11-01 |title=Rensch's Rule Crosses the Line: Convergent Allometry of Sexual Size Dimorphism in Hummingbirds and Flower Mites |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=156 |issue=5 |pages=495–510 |doi=10.1086/303406 |pmid=29587514 |s2cid=4401233}}</ref> Thus, [[sexual selection]] favors smaller male hummingbirds.<ref name="Colwell2000"/>

Another evolutionary cause of this sexual bill dimorphism is that the selective forces from competition for nectar between the sexes of each species drives sexual dimorphism.<ref name="Berns2012"/> Depending on which sex holds territory in the species, the other sex having a longer bill and being able to feed on a wide variety of flowers is advantageous, decreasing [[intraspecific competition]].<ref name="Temeles2010"/> For example, in species of hummingbirds where males have longer bills, males do not hold a specific territory and have a lek mating system.<ref name="Temeles2010"/> In species where males have shorter bills than females, males defend their resources, so females benefit from a longer bill to feed from a broader range of flowers.<ref name="Temeles2010"/>

Hummingbirds exhibit numerous and extensive adaptations to nectarivory, including long, probing bills and tongues which rapidly take up fluids. Hummingbirds also possess the most sophisticated [[Bird flight#Hovering|hovering]] flight of all birds, a necessity for rapidly visiting many flowers without perching. Their [[intestines]] are capable of extracting over 99% of the glucose from nectar feedings within minutes, owing to high densities of glucose transporters (the highest known among vertebrates).<ref name="hoya"/>

As among the most important vertebrate [[pollinator]]s, hummingbirds have [[Coevolution#Birds and bird-pollinated flowers|coevolved]] in complex ways with flowering plants; thousands of [[New World]] species have evolved to be pollinated exclusively by hummingbirds, even barring access to [[insect]] pollinators.<ref name="hoya"/><ref name="hermits"/> In some plants these mechanisms, which include highly modified [[Corolla (flower)|corolla]]s, even render their [[nectaries]] inaccessible to all but certain hummingbirds, i.e., those possessing appropriate beak morphologies (although some hummingbirds rob nectar to overcome this). Bird-pollinated plants (also termed "ornithophilous") were formerly thought to exemplify very close mutualisms, with specific flowering plants coevolving alongside specific hummingbirds in mutualistic pairings. Both ornithophilous plants and hummingbirds are now known to not be nearly selective enough for this to be true.<ref name="hoya"/><ref name="diversity"/><ref name="cali">{{cite journal | last1=Spence | first1=Austin R | last2=Wilson Rankin | first2=Erin E | last3=Tingley | first3=Morgan W | title=DNA metabarcoding reveals broadly overlapping diets in three sympatric North American hummingbirds | journal=Ornithology | publisher=Oxford University Press (OUP) | volume=139 | issue=1 | date=3 December 2021 | url=https://academic.oup.com/auk/article/139/1/ukab074/6429138 | doi=10.1093/ornithology/ukab074 | page=| doi-access=free }}</ref> Less accessible ornithophiles (for example, those requiring long bills) still rely on multiple hummingbird species for pollination. More importantly, hummingbirds tend not to be especially selective nectar-feeders, even regularly visiting non-ornithophilous plants, as well as ornithophiles which appear poorly suited for feeding by their species. Feeding efficiency is optimized, however, when birds feed on flowers better suited to their bill morphologies.<ref name="hoya"/><ref name="hermits"/>

Although they may not be one-to-one, there are still marked overall preferences for certain genera, families, and orders of flowering plants by hummingbirds in general, as well as by certain species of hummingbird. Flowers which are attractive to hummingbirds are often colorful (particularly red), open diurnally, and produce nectar with a high sucrose content; in ornithophilous plants, the corollas are often elongated and tubular, and they may be scentless (several of these are adaptations discouraging insect visitation).<ref name="hoya"/> Some common genera consumed by many species include ''[[Castilleja]]'', ''[[Centropogon]]'', ''[[Costus]]'', ''[[Delphinium]]'', ''[[Heliconia]]'', ''[[Hibiscus]]'', ''[[Inga]]'', and ''[[Mimulus]]''; some of these are primarily insect-pollinated. Three Californian species were found to feed from 62 plant families in 30 orders, with the most frequently occurring orders being [[Apiales]], [[Fabales]], [[Lamiales]], and [[Rosales]].

=== Feeders and artificial nectar ===
[[File:Hummingbirds at feeder.jpg|thumb|Hummingbirds hovering at an artificial nectar feeder]]

In the wild, hummingbirds visit flowers for food, extracting nectar, which is 55% sucrose, 24% glucose, and 21% fructose on a dry-matter basis.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Stahl |first1=J.M. |last2=Nepi |first2=M. |last3=Galetto |first3=L. |last4=Guimarães |first4=E. |last5=Machado |first5=S.R. |year=2012 |title=Functional aspects of floral nectar secretion of Ananas ananassoides, an ornithophilous bromeliad from the Brazilian savanna |journal=Annals of Botany |volume=109 |issue=7 |pages=1243–252 |doi=10.1093/aob/mcs053 |pmc=3359915 |pmid=22455992}}</ref> Hummingbirds also take sugar-water from [[bird feeder]]s, which allow people to observe and enjoy hummingbirds up close while providing the birds with a reliable source of energy, especially when flower blossoms are less abundant.
